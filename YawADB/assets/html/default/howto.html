<h1>HOW TO</h1>
<h2>Why YawADB?</h2>
<p>Despite a variety of similar applications, we decided to develop
another one to better suit our needs.
Since all appropriate names have been used,
we couldn't come up with anything better than
<i>'Yet Another Wireless ADB application'</i>, or YawADB for short. In expectation
that this application can be useful for someone else we release it under GPL.
The source code can be obtained from the project page:
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/yawadb">https://code.google.com/p/yawadb</a>.</p>
 
 <p>YawADB configures a rooted Android device for wireless access through Android Debug Bridge (ADB) without using USB cable connection.
It can be launched either as an app (backward compatible up to API 1),
 or as a widget (compatible up to API 3, the first release featuring applications widgets).
</p>
 
 <p>YawADB is designed to be self aware and keep the information current.
 It can be configured to periodically re-check the status, but even if the refresh
 is disabled or infrequent, the application still tries its best
 to provide up-to-time feedback.</p>
 
<p>The application provides a number of customised features for someone who likes
experimenting and know what they are doing.</p>    
 
 <p>Being not authorised to translate GPL text to other languages,
 we  for consistency decided to leave the other text untranslated too.
 <i>SVP, entschuldigen Sie-nous per queste molestias.</i> Another
 reason for such a decision is that a widget must be installed in device internal memory where the size is often crucial.
 Since the text is not hard-coded, support for another language can be easily added.</p>

<h2>Customised features</h2>
<p><b><u>Port number</u></b>. Specifies port to use for connection. Use default value <tt>5555</tt>,
unless it clashes with another application.</p>

<p><b><u>Auto-refresh</u></b> (widget mode only). If auto-refresh is enabled, the widget re-checks
the status of ADB daemon in the specified interval of time. If disabled (default value),
the status is re-checked only on connectivity change (such as lost/regained connection,
or airplane mode), when YawADB icon is tapped, or after enable/disable wireless connection <i>using YawADB</i>.
Auto-refresh is recommended when there are several applications
changing wireless ADB status, or ADB daemon is unstable on your device
(a rather unlikely possibility).</p>

<p><b><u>SU path</u></b>. The path of <tt>su</tt> program (e.g. <tt>/system/bin/su</tt>). If the full path
is not specified, the directory should be listed in PATH environment variable.</p>

<p>If your device is rooted only for ADB, you may still succeed in running YawADB. 
For example, you may create a <i>suid-rooted</i> copy of <tt>/system/bin/sh</tt>
(please, don't ask to go into the details!) and set this  copy as
<tt>SU Path</tt> for YawADB. <i>Be aware that this makes your device unsafe
by allowing to execute rooted commands without any notification!</i>
For that reason using a rooted device is certainly a preferred option.</p>

<p><b><u>Network</u></b>. Name of interface, used for wireless ADB. The standard name is <tt>wlan0</tt>,
however some devices use <tt>tiwlan0</tt> or even <tt>eth0</tt>. It the name is specified as <tt>wifi</tt> 
(default value), YawADB will get IP address from Android WiFi service (WifiManager class). 
The parameter opens a door for trying mobile connections
(such as <tt>rmnet</tt>), and if you succeed, take our congratulations.</p>

<p>Due to a rather awkward Android design the default option works only with IPv4 network.
If the interface name is specified explicitly, the application will use IPv4 network,
or IPv6 network, if IPv4 network is unavailable. If <tt>:6</tt> is appended to the network name
(e.g <tt>wlan0:6</tt>), the IPv6 network has preference over IPv4. (Yes,
ADB currently does not support IPv6, but it hopefully will in the future.)     
     
<p><b><u>ADBD restart</u></b>. In order to accept the new mode, ADB daemon should be restarted. In <i>normal</i>
mode (default) the daemon is stopped using <tt>stop adbd</tt> command, which may fail, if the daemon is busy or stalled.
In <i>forced</i> mode the daemon is stopped by sending SIGKILL to its PID. It almost guarantees the daemon to
stop, but precludes it from performing clean-up. Use it with care.</p>      
    
<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>
<p><b><u>YawADB icon is green, but ADB client does not see the device</u></b>.</p>
<p>Assuming the client deviceget is connected to the network and not behind a firewall, re-entering&nbsp; <tt>adb connect</tt>&nbsp; will do the trick.</p>


<p><b><u>Wireless ADB is turned off, but ADB client does not recognise the device, connected to USB</u></b>.</p>

<p>Disconnect the device and re-connect it. Alternatively you can restart the ADB
server on the client side using</p>
<pre>
  adb kill-server
  adb start-server
</pre>
